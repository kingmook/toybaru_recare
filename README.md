# Toybaru ReCare

A self-hosted dashboard for the Subaru Solterra and Trailseeker, Toyota bZ4X, and related Toyota/Lexus EVs that gives you access to your own vehicle data -- the data that Subaru and Toyota collect but never show you.

Primary target is **EU (Subaru Solterra on SubaruConnect)**. North American Toyota, Lexus, and Subaru profiles are supported for login and the parts of each provider API that work. NA capabilities differ substantially by provider and vehicle; see the provider notes below.

## Why this exists

I built this because Subaru silently deleted all my trip data from 2024. One day it was there, the next it was gone. No warning, no export option, no backup. Almost a year of driving history, just wiped from their servers.

That pissed me off enough to start poking around the SubaruConnect API. What I found was surprising: the API collects far more data than the app ever shows you. For every single trip, Subaru tracks:

- **Overspeed logging** -- every point on your route where you exceeded the speed limit is flagged with `overspeed: true`. Subaru knows exactly where and when you were speeding. This is never shown in the app.
- **Driving behaviour events** -- every hard brake, every aggressive acceleration is logged with GPS coordinates, timestamps, severity scores, and even road gradient. The app shows you a vague "driving score" but never the raw events.
- **Driving mode per route point** -- every few meters, the car records whether you were in Eco, Power, or Regeneration mode. The full route is reconstructed with mode-colored segments.

None of this is visible in the Subaru Care app. Your car is basically a telemetry device on wheels, and you have no access to your own data.

So I built a dashboard around it. Import your trips, store them locally (so Subaru can't delete them again), browse your routes on a map, see where you braked hard, check your efficiency stats, and export everything as CSV or JSON.

## Features

**Vehicle Overview**
- Battery state of charge, range (with and without climate), charging status
- Battery bar color-coded for EV-optimal range: green (10-80%), yellow (>80%, wear risk), red (<10%, low)
- Charger level detection (Level 1 / Level 2 / DC Fast L3) with kW rate, estimated full time, and raw chargeType code
- Vehicle hero card with official Toyota/Subaru render image, color, nickname, and model info
- Manufactured date and first-use date
- Vehicle capabilities shown as badges (Digital Key, Solar Panel, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, etc.)
- Active subscription tracker with color-coded expiry dates (green >1yr, yellow <1yr, red <90 days)
- HVAC climate preset settings displayed in Remote Controls (temperature, blower, defoggers)
- Door/window/hatch lock status with open/closed indicators
- Last known GPS position on a map
- Top-down vehicle illustration on the start page, tinted to match your car's actual paint colour
- Remote controls (still in testing -- see notes): lock/unlock doors, lock/unlock hatch, headlights on/off, hazard lights on/off, sound horn, buzzer warning, engine start/stop, find vehicle
- Provider-aware command capability resolution: controls are disabled when the provider explicitly reports that a command is unsupported
- Capability diagnostics available by appending `?debug` to the dashboard URL; the panel shows the provider, active subscriptions, capability decision, and source field for each command. An unknown capability is not confirmation that a command is supported.
- Unit labels follow the upstream account setting (km/h vs mph, °C vs °F). The dashboard never converts values -- it only shows the unit string the API reports.
- Date/time format adapts to region (DD/MM/YYYY 24h for EU; MM/DD/YYYY 12h AM/PM for NA)
- Last trip summary with key metrics (EU only -- see note below)

**Battery Health**
- Battery health graph tracking SOC % and estimated range over time
- Charging session indicators on the graph (green dots when plugged in)
- Lifetime charge session counter from Toyota's plugInHistory field
- Estimated energy throughput calculation (based on charge cycles and battery capacity)
- Charge frequency tracking (sessions per month since first use)
- All data logged locally via snapshot tracker for long-term degradation analysis

**OTP / Two-Factor Authentication**
- Full support for Toyota NA's ForgeRock OTP flow
- OTP codes are delivered via email (check spam/junk if not received)
- Two-phase login: enter credentials → enter OTP code → dashboard loads
- Works with both the web dashboard and CLI

**Trip Browser**
- All trips in a sortable, filterable table
- Date range selection
- Score badges (color-coded: green >80, yellow >60, red <60)
- Eco/Regeneration/Power distribution per trip as stacked bar
- Hard braking and acceleration event counts
- Click any trip for the detail view

**Trip Detail View**
- Interactive zoomable map with the driven route
- Route colored by driving mode (green=Eco, blue=Regeneration, red=Power)
- Start and end markers
- Braking and acceleration events as colored dots on the map
- Hover tooltips showing mode, overspeed status, and coordinates
- Score breakdown (overall, acceleration, braking, consistency)
- Driving behaviour event table with timestamps and ratings
- Raw JSON view ("Stats for Nerds")

**Statistics**

- Total trips, kilometers, hours driven, km per day
- Average and max speed, average scores (overall, acceleration, braking)
- Eco/Regeneration/Power efficiency breakdown with stacked bar
- Monthly km bar chart with score trend
- Trips by weekday and time of day (24h histogram)
- Speed category breakdown (city <40, rural 40-80, highway >80 km/h)
- Score distribution histogram
- Idle time, overspeed km, night trip percentage
- Records: longest trip, top speed, best score, best regeneration, most km in a day

**Data Management**
- Import all historical trips from the Subaru API with live progress log
- Incremental sync (fetch only new trips since last import)
- Export trips as CSV (structured columns) or JSON (including route and behaviour data)
- Re-import from a previously exported JSON file (UPSERT, no duplicates)
- Local SQLite database -- your data stays on your machine

**Security**
- CSRF protection on all state-changing endpoints
- Authentication required on all data/export endpoints
- No plaintext password storage -- only username and region are saved locally
- PKCE S256 for OAuth2 authorization code flow
- JWT signature verification via ForgeRock JWKS
- Sanitized error messages (detailed errors logged server-side only)
- XSS hardening (textContent for dynamic content, no inline handlers with user data)
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- Rate limiting on login, OTP, vehicle commands, and experimental electric commands
- Explicit confirmation, operator-controlled feature gates, and a local audit trail for experimental charging commands
- Session expiry with automatic cleanup
- VIN format validation
- Docker container runs as non-root user

**Toyota NA Region Support**
- Full Toyota North America API integration alongside existing Subaru EU
- Automatic endpoint and header adaptation per region
- Battery data normalization (NA format → standard format)
- plugStatus mapping (including codes 4, 12, 40, 45) with connectorStatus fallback
- HVAC climate settings extracted from electric status endpoint
- Vehicle info: image, color, nickname, capabilities, subscriptions, manufactured/first-use dates
- Solar panel status detection (equipped vs N/A)
- Charge cycle tracking via plugInHistory counter
- Trips, Statistics, and Data tabs automatically hidden when the selected provider profile has no trip endpoint
- Toyota NA does not currently expose trip or charging-session history through the configured API profile
- Unit display follows the API's per-field unit (e.g. miles/mph for a NA account, km/km/h for an EU account) -- no client-side conversion

**Subaru NA / Trailseeker Support**
- Subaru North America authentication and provider-specific OneApp headers
- Battery, vehicle status, location, remote capabilities, and vehicle-health data
- Charging history and charging statistics from the Subaru NA charging service
- Charge-management summary with remaining charging time
- Charging schedules and the next charging event can be preserved and displayed behind the read-only `TOYBARU_EXPERIMENTAL_CHARGE_SCHEDULES` gate while the provider schema is being validated
- Notifications and service/maintenance history are loaded only when requested, avoiding unnecessary provider requests
- No trip-history endpoint is configured for Subaru NA

**Experimental Charging Controls**
- Charge Now and charging-schedule commands are disabled by default and require `TOYBARU_EXPERIMENTAL_CHARGE_COMMANDS=true`
- Every command requires an explicit confirmation in the dashboard and is subject to a separate per-vehicle rate limit
- Command attempts and provider outcomes are recorded in a local audit log
- A successful response means the provider gateway accepted an asynchronous request; it does not confirm that the vehicle completed the command
- The Subaru NA schedule-command payload is based on an EU analogue and remains unverified; leave the feature disabled until a sanitized provider fixture has been validated

**Multi-language**
- 9 locales: German (`de`), English UK (`en`), English US (`en-US`), Spanish ES (`es-ES`), Spanish MX (`es-MX`), French FR (`fr-FR`), French CA (`fr-CA`), Japanese (`ja-JP`), Dutch (`nl-NL`)
- Each locale ships its own metric/imperial unit words (e.g. `Kilometer`/`Meilen` in German, `km/u` in Dutch). Translation strings reference them via `{distLong}`, `{speed}`, `{cityThr}` placeholders -- the dashboard substitutes the right one based on the API account's unit setting.
- Add more languages by dropping a JSON file into the locales directory
- Language switcher dropdown, preference saved in browser

**Auto-Sync**
- Configurable automatic data refresh: Off, 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 minute intervals
- Preference saved in browser and persists across sessions

**Brand-Aware Theming**
- Light and dark mode toggle, saved in browser
- Theme colors automatically match your brand: Toyota Red or Subaru Blue
- Inspired by the official Toyota and MySubaru iOS apps
- Brand is auto-detected from your login, or previewed when selecting a brand on the login screen

**Multi-vehicle**
- Vehicle switcher in the top bar
- All data stored per VIN
- Works if your account has multiple vehicles linked

## Installation

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingmook/toybaru_recare.git
cd toybaru_recare
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8099, sign in with your Subaru or Toyota account credentials. Toyota NA users will be prompted for an OTP code delivered via email.

Your data is stored in a Docker volume (`toybaru-data`). It persists across container restarts and rebuilds.

### Local (Python)

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingmook/toybaru_recare.git
cd toybaru_recare
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
toybaru dashboard
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8099.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI directly:

```bash
toybaru login -r EU
toybaru vehicles
toybaru status <VIN>
toybaru battery <VIN>
toybaru trips <VIN> --from 2025-01-01 --json
toybaru import-trips <VIN> --from 2024-06-01
toybaru trip-stats
toybaru raw GET /v2/vehicle/guid
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TOYBARU_DATA_DIR` | `~/.config/toybaru` | Directory for databases, tokens, and config |
| `TOYBARU_SECURE_COOKIES` | `false` | Set to `true` to require HTTPS for session cookies (auto-detected if behind a reverse proxy with `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`) |
| `TOYBARU_EXPERIMENTAL_CHARGE_SCHEDULES` | `false` | Display preserved Subaru NA charging-schedule fields. Read-only; enable only while validating a sanitized provider fixture. |
| `TOYBARU_EXPERIMENTAL_CHARGE_COMMANDS` | `false` | Enable confirmation-gated Charge Now and schedule commands with local auditing. Subaru NA uses an unconfirmed EU-analogue payload; leave disabled until a provider fixture is validated. |

For Docker, pass an opt-in flag through the `toybaru` service environment. For example, this enables only the read-only schedule display:

```yaml
services:
  toybaru:
    environment:
      - TOYBARU_EXPERIMENTAL_CHARGE_SCHEDULES=true
```

Recreate the container after changing its environment:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate toybaru
```

Do not enable `TOYBARU_EXPERIMENTAL_CHARGE_COMMANDS` for Subaru NA until the command payload has been validated against a sanitized provider fixture. Enabling it allows confirmed dashboard actions to contact the vehicle gateway.

## Configuration

### Region config

The tool ships with EU (Europe) and NA (North America) configurations. These are the API endpoints, client IDs, and authentication realms needed to talk to the Subaru/Toyota backend.

To override or add regions, create a `regions.json` file in your data directory:

```bash
# Docker
docker compose cp regions.example.json toybaru:/data/regions.json

# Local
cp regions.example.json ~/.config/toybaru/regions.json
```

Edit the file to change values. You only need to include the fields you want to override -- missing fields fall back to the built-in defaults. See `regions.example.json` for the full structure.

Endpoint versions are profile-specific. Toyota EU uses the migrated 2026 status
routes and V2 climate-control payloads. Only safe Toyota EU `GET` requests may
fall back to a configured legacy route, and only after a `404`, `405`, or `410`.
Fallback is never performed for writes, refresh requests, authentication errors,
rate limits, or server failures. The Toyota EU profile also rejects the legacy
standalone climate-settings write locally instead of translating it into a
vehicle command. Lexus, Subaru, and North American profiles retain their
independently validated routes and request formats.

### Adding a language

Create a new JSON file in `src/toybaru/locales/`, for example `fr.json`:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "locale": "fr-FR",
    "label": "Francais"
  },
  "app": {
    "name": "Toybaru ReCare",
    ...
  }
}
```

Use `en.json` as a template. The language will appear automatically in the dropdown after restarting the server.

## First steps after installation

1. Open the dashboard and sign in with your Subaru or Toyota account (same credentials as the SubaruConnect / Toyota app)
2. Toyota NA users: enter the OTP code sent to your email (check spam/junk folder -- codes come from `donotreply@toyotaconnectedservices.com` for Toyota or `noreply@subaruconnectedservices.io` for Subaru)
3. **EU users:** Go to the **Data** tab, set the "From" date to when you got your car and click **Start import**
4. Wait for the import to finish (about 1 minute per 100 trips)
5. Go to **Trips** to browse your data, **Statistics** for the overview
6. **Toyota NA users:** Trip and charging-session history are not available through the configured API profile. Vehicle data, remote controls, and on-demand notification/service history remain available where returned by the provider.
7. **Subaru NA users:** Trip history is unavailable, but supported vehicles can expose charging history/statistics, vehicle health, charge-management data, and on-demand notification/service history.

After the initial import, use the **Fetch new trips** button on the Trips tab to pull only the latest data.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

## Important notes

- **Tested on a 2023 Subaru Solterra (EU / Germany), a 2026 Toyota bZ4X XLE FWD PLUS (NA / US), and a 2026 Subaru Trailseeker (NA).** EU remains the primary target. Availability still varies by provider, subscription, model, and region.
- **Remote commands are still in testing.** They are wired up end-to-end and will return success when the cloud accepts the command, but they are fire-and-forget: the car has to wake up to actually execute them (15-60s). Availability varies by model and region. Treat a success response as "cloud accepted", not "car did it".
- **Toyota NA uses OTP via email for authentication.** The codes arrive from `donotreply@toyotaconnectedservices.com` (Toyota) or `noreply@subaruconnectedservices.io` (Subaru) and may land in your spam folder.
- **Toyota NA does not provide trip or charging-session history through the configured profile.** Those tabs are hidden when their backing endpoints are unavailable. This limitation does not apply to Subaru NA charging history/statistics, although Subaru NA still has no configured trip-history endpoint.
- **Subaru NA charging controls are experimental and disabled by default.** Read-only schedule fields and write commands have separate operator flags. Commands require confirmation, are rate-limited and audited, and return only an asynchronous gateway acknowledgement.
- **Subaru deletes trip data after approximately 12 months.** This is why local storage matters. Import your data regularly.
- **The API does not provide kWh consumption per trip.** The endpoints for energy data exist but return 403 (Forbidden) for the Subaru API client.
- **No official API documentation exists.** This project is based on reverse-engineering the mobile apps and community research (see Credits).

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest tests/ -v
```

The dashboard charging-estimate tests use Node.js (18+), with no npm dependencies:

```bash
node --test tests/dashboard_charge_estimate.test.cjs
```

## Contributing

This project is tested with one car in one country. If you have a Solterra or bZ4X in a different region and want to help, contributions are welcome:

- Verify and fix region configurations for other markets (Japan, Australia, etc.)
- Add translations (just create a new JSON file in `src/toybaru/locales/`)
- Report what works and what doesn't on your vehicle
- Help discover additional Toyota NA API endpoints (trips, charging history)
